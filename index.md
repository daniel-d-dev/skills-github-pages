Welcome to my blog! I'm currently transitioning from a background in SEO and content management to web development, and this space is where I'll share my journey. As I learn and grow in the dev world, I'll be documenting key projects, insights, and challenges, from front-end experiments to deeper dives into the world of web technologies. I hope this blog serves as a resource for fellow learners and tech enthusiasts, and Iâ€™m excited to connect with others on this journey!
